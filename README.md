## Project Description:
- This project focuses on analyzing Airbnb listing data using Python to uncover key trends, patterns, and actionable insights that can help hosts, travelers, and stakeholders make informed decisions. The project involved end-to-end data handling, from cleaning raw datasets to performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and deriving insights on pricing, availability, and location-based trends.

- The analysis was conducted using publicly available Airbnb datasets, applying Python's data analytics libraries to transform, visualize, and interpret the data effectively.

## Key Objectives and Activities:
- Imported and explored Airbnb listing datasets containing details such as property types, locations, prices, availability, host information, and reviews.

- Performed extensive data cleaning, including handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistent formats.

- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify:

- Distribution of property types (e.g., apartments, private rooms, entire homes)

- Price trends across neighborhoods and cities

- Availability patterns throughout the year

- Relationship between customer reviews, pricing, and listing popularity

- Applied Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.

- Generated visual reports to present key findings, such as price heatmaps, review score distributions, and neighborhood comparison charts.

## Technologies & Tools Used:
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code (for code execution and documentation)

- Airbnb Open Data for Listings and Reviews

## Project Outcomes:
- ✔ Identified pricing trends and neighborhood hotspots for Airbnb rentals
- ✔ Discovered factors influencing higher listing prices (property type, location, reviews)
- ✔ Provided data-driven insights to help optimize listing strategies and booking performance
- ✔ Strengthened skills in data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and visual storytelling using Python
